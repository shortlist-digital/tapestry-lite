# Tapestry Lite

> Fast Dynamic Websites with WordPress and React

## Quickstart

Install Tapestry Lite and React:

```sh
npm install tapestry-lite react react-dom
```

Create a `tapestry.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```js
// tapestry.config.js
import Post from './post'

export default {
  siteUrl: 'https://www.mysite.com',
  components: { Post }
}

//post.js
const Post = props => (

  <article>
    <h1>{props.title.rendered}</h1>
    <section dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: props.content.rendered}} />
  <article>
)
```

Run the tapestry development server:

```sh
npx tapestry dev
```

## In a nutshell

- Build for the web with elegance or React's component model
- Empower your customers and colleagues with WordPress to manage content
- Server side rendering, for dynamic content, SEO, no static build step

## The magic bits

- Full Server side render out of the box
- Client side navigation and render after initial load
- True critical CSS. Tapestry inlines only the styles for components rendered.
- Tapestry handles fetching data from the WP-API
- Install the Tapestry WP plugin for deep integration
- Code splitting with (customisable) Webpack 4

## Why use Tapestry?

### You love building with React.

A wise person once tweeted something to the effect of "Reacts killer feature isn't setState, it's that it nailed the component model."

We think colocating markup, styling, and interaction code is the best way to manage front-end projects: Or to put it another way, separation of concerns doesn't mean separation of files.

### You need a proper CMS.

We've tried to teach people to use GitHub and Markdown; we've tried to build our own CMS's - and gotten bogged down in rebuilding login flows, password resets, text editors, taxonomies, access privilege systems.

For all it's flaws, there's a reason WordPress powers 25% of the internet.

Use a system that millions of people have used, tens of thousands of developers have contributed to, and content management functionality that's expanded and matured over a decade. Get timely security updates, an expansive plugin ecosystem, and regular new features. For free!
