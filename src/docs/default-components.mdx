# Default Components

The fastest way to build a site with default WordPress routing and Tapestry, is to provide an object of "default components".

```js
//tapestry.config.js

import { Post, FrontPage, Category, Page } from './src/components'

export default {
  siteUrl: 'https://www.mywordpress.com',
  components: {
    Post,
    FrontPage,
    Category,
    Page
  }
}
```

## Post

The top level component for a post, (think of `single.php` if you're in WordPress theme world).

### Route

By default posts will be rendered at the "out of the box" route path:

```
/:category/:year/:monthnum/:postname
```

### Data

Data will be fetched from the `posts?slug=my-post-slug&_embed` endpoint.

By default the WordPress API will return the last ten posts from your site

## FrontPage

### Route

Tapestry will render this component on the root `/` of your site.

### Data

Data will be fetched from the `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed` endpoint.

By default the WordPress API will return the last ten posts from your site.
